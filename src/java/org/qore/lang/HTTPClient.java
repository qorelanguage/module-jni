        @par Example:
        @code{.java}
    HTTPClient httpclient = new HTTPClient(opts);
        @endcode

        @param opts sets options and changes default behaviour for the object, etc; key names are case-sensitive and therefore must all be in lower-case:
        - \c additional_methods: An optional hash defining additional HTTP methods to handle.  This allows the HTTPClient class to handle various HTTP extensions like e.g. WebDAV. The hash is defined with new method names as keys; the values are @ref true or @ref false indicating if the method can accept a message body; for example:
        @code{.java}
        # add two new HTTP methods for WebDAV; both require message bodies
        HTTPClient httpclient(("url": url, "additional_methods": ("PROPFIND": True, "MKCOL": True )));
        @endcode
        - \c connect_timeout: The timeout value in milliseconds for establishing a new socket connection (also can be a @ref relative_dates "relative date-time value" for clarity, ex: \c 30s)
        - \c default_path: The default path to use for new connections if a path is not otherwise specified in the connection URL
        - \c default_port: The default port number to connect to if none is given in the URL
        - \c http_version: Either \c "1.0" or \c "1.1" for the claimed HTTP protocol version compliancy in outgoing message headers
        - \c max_redirects: The maximum number of redirects before throwing an exception (the default is 5)
        - \c protocols: A hash describing new protocols, the key is the protocol name and the value is either an integer giving the default port number or a hash with \c "port" and \c "ssl" keys giving the default port number and a boolean value to indicate that an SSL connection should be established
        - \c proxy: The proxy URL for connecting through a proxy
        - \c ssl_cert_path: a path to an X.509 client certificate file in PEM format; if this option is used, then the calling context must not be restricted with sandbox restriction @ref Qore::PO_NO_FILESYSTEM which is checked at runtime
        - \c ssl_key_path: a path to a private key file in PEM format for the X.509 client certificate; if this option is used, then the calling context must not be restricted with sandbox restriction @ref Qore::PO_NO_FILESYSTEM which is checked at runtime
        - \c ssl_key_password: the password to the private key given with \c ssl_key_path
        - \c ssl_verify_cert: if @ref true then the server's certificate will only be accepted if it's verified
        - \c timeout: The timeout value in milliseconds (also can be a @ref relative_dates "relative date-time value" for clarity, ex: \c 5m)
        - \c url: A string giving the URL to connect to

        @throw HTTP-CLIENT-OPTION-ERROR invalid or unknown option passed in option hash
        @throw HTTP-CLIENT-URL-ERROR invalid URL string
        @throw HTTP-CLIENT-UNKNOWN-PROTOCOL unknown protocol passed in URL
        @throw ILLEGAL-FILESYSTEM-ACCESS if the calling context is restricted with the @ref Qore::PO_NO_FILESYSTEM sandboxing restriction and one of the following options is used: \c ssl_cert_path or \c ssl_key_path

        @note
        - URLs with UNIX sockets are generally supported in Qore with the following syntax: <tt><b>scheme://socket=</b></tt><i>url_encoded_path</i><tt><b>/path</b></tt>, where <i>url_encoded_path</i> is a path with URL-encoding as performed by @ref encode_url() "encode_url(string, True)"; for example: \c "http://socket=%2ftmp%socket-dir%2fsocket-file-1/url/path"; this allows a filesystem path to be used in the host portion of the URL and for the URL to include a URL path as well.
        - other I/O errors can be thrown opening and reading the certificate and/or private key files if the \c ssl_cert_path or \c ssl_key_path options are used
        - the @ref Qore::PO_NO_FILESYSTEM sandbox restriction is checked at runtime if one of the following options is used: \c ssl_cert_path or \c ssl_key_path

        @since %Qore 0.8.13 added the following options:
